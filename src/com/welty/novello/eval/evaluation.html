The evaluation function is used for three purposes:
<ul>
    <li>Move ordering in the Solver</li>
    <li>Choosing moves in self-play games (to generate a new evaluation function)</li>
    <li>Evaluating positions in self-play games (to generate a new evaluation function)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>The evaluation function is a sum of term values similar to <a href="https://skatgame.net/mburo/ps/evalfunc.pdf">Logistello's</a>.
</p>

<p class="equation">Evaluation = &Sigma;<sub>t</sub> value<sub>t</sub>(position).</p>

<p>Each value(position) is calculated by lookup table. The lookup table is called the <b>coefficientSet</b>: </p>

<p class="equation">value(position) = coefficientSet[nEmpty][eval.iFeature(term)][term.instance(position)]</p>

<p><b>nEmpty</b> is the number of empty squares in the position.</p>

<p><b>term</b> is a Term object. Each Term implements a function instance() which maps a position to an integer.
    That integer is called an <b>instance</b>. Examples of Terms are</p>
<ul>
    <li>"number of mover mobilities", which maps a position to the number of available moves for the mover.</li>
    <li>"configuration of disks along the North edge of the board", which produces a distinct integer for
        each pattern of disks along the north edge of the board.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>Feature</b> is a set of Terms that share the same coefficients.For example the North, South,
    East, and West edges of the board all use the same Feature due to symmetry.</p>

<p><b>eval</b> is the evaluation function. eval.iFeature(term) maps each term's feature to an index in the lookup table. If there are multiple Terms with
    the same Feature, eval.iFeature returns the same index for all of those Terms.</p>
<h3>Patterns and Configurations</h3>

<p> Some terms use patterns. A <b>pattern</b> is a set of squares, e.g. A1..H1. A <b>configuration</b> is a
    specific assignment of disks to a pattern, e.g. A1..A8 = *OO-*OO*. Each configuration is mapped to an
    instance by viewing the pattern a base-3 value, where empty = 0, mover = 1 and enemy = 2.
    So *OO-*OO* is mapped to 12201221<sub>3</sub> = 4183 if black is to move.</p>

<h2>Determining coefficient values</h2>

<p>
    The Feature also determines which instances have the same value; for instance by symmetry a North edge of
    *OOO---- should have the same value as a North edge of ----OOO*. int Feature.orid(instance) returns the same
    <b>orid</b> for instances which should have the same value - the orid is an equivalence class on instances.
</p>

<p>We obtain feature values by regression. The coefficient calculator takes in a set of position/value pairs.
    For each pair, the orid is determined for each term. Currently we use a linear regression targeting the net game
    result to obtain values for the orids.</p>

<p>To determine the feature values for nEmpty empties, we currently examine only positions with nEmpty empties.
    Later on we will use nEmpty +/-2 in order to reduce instabilities in the evaluation function.</p>

<p>To create the position/value pairs we use positions from self-play games with target value being the game result.</p>
