Eval Speed
==========
It is getting awfully slow. Time to speed it up! Created timing test EvalPlayerTimer.

Self-play b1:6:

2426 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 1.6 us/eval
1677 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 1.1 us/eval: convert base2 to base3 using a lookup table.
1622 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 1.1 us/eval : Use kindergarten bitboards to get col indices
1427 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.9 us/eval: Specialize CornerFeature2 terms in eval
1013 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.7 us/eval: Specialize mobility/disk/pot mob terms in eval
634 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.4 us/eval: specialize rest of eval
611 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.4 us/eval: reorder calculations in specialized eval so similar rows & cols are together
597 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.4 us/eval: reorder calculations in specialized eval so similar diagonals are together
596 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.4 us/eval: simplify col calculation
558 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.4 us/eval: simplify row calculation
509 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.34 us/eval: simplify diagonal calculation
490 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.32 us/eval: generate code for mobs, pot mobs
480 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.32 us/eval: generate code for Corner2
467 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.31 us/eval: generate code for all eval Terms
489 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.32 us/eval: attempt to speed up code for Corner2 - not keeping
437 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.29 us/eval: kogge-stone mobility calc, first pass
429 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.28 us/eval: speed up kogge-stone
433 ms elapsed / 1,517,470 evals. 0.29 us/eval: Manually inline kogge-stone and reorder computations - not keeping
slightly slower: use bit twiddling instead of if statements in CornerTerm2.
