Initial implementation
======================
data from SearchTimer

kNodes, using eval b1 (eval c1s results are virtually identical):

    depth full-width    mpc
    1             4       4
    2            19      19
    3           100      60
    4           279     136
    5          1149     361
    6          3201     856
    7         12163    1819

A tournament between the same eval, with depths 4 and 5 (with mpc) and 3 and 4 (without mpc):  w=full-width

    +16.4  c1s:5
     +4.4  c1s:4w
     -1.4  c1s:4
    -19.4  c1s:3w

Looking at a graph of tournament result vs log (nodes), mpc is quite a bit above full-width search.

A tournament with lower-depth players:

    +11.4  c1s:3w
     +8.6  c1s:3
    -20.0  c1s:2

Estimated strength differences between various MPC plies is therefore:
    2-3 28.8
    3-4 20.8
    4-5 15.0
    5-6 13.4
