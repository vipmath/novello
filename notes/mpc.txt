Initial implementation
======================
data from SearchTimer

kNodes, using eval b1 (eval c1s results are virtually identical):

    depth full-width    mpc
    1             4       4
    2            19      19
    3           100      60
    4           279     136
    5          1149     361
    6          3201     856
    7         12163    1819

A tournament between the same eval, with depths 4 and 5 (with mpc) and 3 and 4 (without mpc):  w=full-width

    +16.4  c1s:5
     +4.4  c1s:4w
     -1.4  c1s:4
    -19.4  c1s:3w

Looking at a graph of tournament result vs log (nodes), mpc is quite a bit above full-width search.

A tournament with lower-depth players:

    +11.4  c1s:3w
     +8.6  c1s:3
    -20.0  c1s:2

Estimated strength differences between various MPC plies is therefore:
    2-3 28.8
    3-4 20.8
    4-5 15.0
    5-6 13.4

Move Sorting
------------
Costs at the beginning [3ec7]:
    1     22
    2     97
    3    318
    4    694
    5  1,889
    6  4,468
    7  9,272
    8 17,845
    9 36,072

Costs after mpc move sorting [da65], (with very slightly different MPC coefficients, using evaluator c1s)
    depth   fw     mpc
     1      22      22
     2      97      97
     3     525     313
     4   1,310     627
     5   5,831   1,505
     6  15,009   3,172
     7  61,659   6,276
     8          10,913
     9          20,429
    10          34,173
    11          88,810
    12         186,205

Note the poor performance past 10 ply. MPC cuts are defined only up to 9 ply. In order to do deeper cuts, we'll
get new MPC stats (copied from c4s, which causes a slight difference in costs). Without deeper cuts, but with the new
MPC stats, mpc costs are:
      1      22
      2      97
      3     318
      4     644
      5   1,549
      6   3,287
      7   6,661
      8  11,606
      9  21,761
     10  38,002
     11 101,178
     12 224,106

With mpc cuts added at depth 10 and 11, this becomes
     1      22
     2      97
     3     318
     4     644
     5   1,549
     6   3,287
     7   6,661
     8  11,606
     9  21,761
    10  38,002
    11  67,114
    12 115,228

Having MPC at all depths up to search depth-1 is thus vital for ensuring good performance.
