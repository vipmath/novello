Hash Table
----------

Comparing alternatives using SearchTimer total cost at depth 10.

135,663 : original
135,311 : load & store when depth > 2  in treeMove()
133,835 : load when depth > 2, store always  in treeMove()
108,170 : load and store at all depths
 90,655 : above + beta cutoffs at all depths
 88,679 : above + alpha cutoffs at all depths

For reference, costs at all depths up to 10 using the final result:
    depth   k$
     1      22
     2      74
     3     288
     4     684
     5   1,945
     6   4,527
     7  10,436
     8  21,626
     9  45,693
    10  88,678

Forced Moves
------------
If the player-to-move has one legal move, should he play it before evaluating?
ntestJ-x plays the move before evaluating.

ntestJ-x:10 vs ntestJ-:10:
    3,216 matches: average result = +0.0211 +/-0.035. T ~   0.6.  368 ms vs 368 ms.

Not very useful, reverting.

Fix MPC in solver
-----------------
Currently MPC widths are calculated assuming the midgame solver start depth is 0. In fact it's set to 6 for strong
engines. Modify MPC so that coefficients are wider when hitting the terminal position, and evaluate the change
by playing it vs ntest. Something is wrong with ntest, it is taking 1s/game even at 4 ply. Since it will take a long time
anyway, play it at 12 ply:
Original version:
     d3-V:12 vs NTest:12: -1.95 +/-0.30. T ~  -6.5.  566 ms vs 1.91 s.
Modified version:
     d3-V:12 vs NTest:12: -1.73 +/-0.072. T ~ -23.9.  565 ms vs 1.86 s.

Getting this far with the modified version required an overnight run.
I will need to speed up the testing before drawing conclusions.
