Viewer Spec
===========

The Viewer allows a user to review games and to play vs a bot.

This spec is incomplete. Only certain features are specced.

Startup
-------
On startup, the Viewer immediately starts a new game as per the New Game spec.

New Game
--------
When the user chooses New Game, a new game is created.

According to the selection in the "Play As" menu, the user plays Black or White.
The opponent will be an engine. Currently the only supported engine is Novello.
[Future: Support NBoard engines.] The engine depth is the depth chosen from the "Level" menu.
Once the game is started, the engine/depth/colors can't be changed.

The start position is the standard start position.

> Tech note: In the viewer, only one Engine is created. When a new game is started its depth is set.
