Coefficient Calculation
=======================
Created pvs and pvsx from 10-ply evals using c4s:10 instead of using playouts; targets for
coefficient calculation were capped at +/-64 disks. Also switched pvs
and pvsx generation to be multithreaded and only calculate distinct MRs once.

Pvs generation took about 12 hours.

However the number of distinct positions seems a lot lower; wondering if there's a problem.

Comparing with frequency.txt, the number of positions used to estimate coefficients

    # empty  frequency.txt  c6s log
    4         2,328,853     739,106
    20        6,652,806   1,733,345
    36        8,123,805   1,892,370

c5s:4s vs c6s:4s: average result = -0.7

This is not a very big improvement.
