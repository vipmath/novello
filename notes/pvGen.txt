Improved PV generation
=======================

Improve in 3 ways:
1. Multithreaded to improve speed
2. Use a deeper search instead of a playout
3. Spend more time to get even deeper playouts.

Since there are no unit tests for the PV generation, we'll have to run it and make sure the resulting
coefficients perform.

To test change #1, run the same coefficients single-threaded and multi-threaded.
